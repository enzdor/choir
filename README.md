# Choir

Create regression trees based on CART book by Breiman et al.

## TODO

- Pruning
- Read CSV (or create small csv reading lib)
	- separate vars into ordered and categorical
	- make it work with large files
- for x switch to flattened 2d array instead of true 2d array
- Error handling
	- instead of exiting the program, implement correct error handling for an
	api. Check how other projects do it.
